# MY Robot Simulator
•	Tech stack: JavaScript

• Created an algorithm to place a robot at a coordinate in the room, facing in a particular direction

• The program receives a number of instructions, at which point the algorithm verifies the robot's new position and orientation, and in which direction it is pointing

•Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular

direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,

e.g., {3,8}.

•The test algorithm is to place a robot at a coordinate in the room,

facing in a particular direction.

•The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the

testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which

direction it is pointing.

•The robot factory's test facility has a simulator which can take a

string of letters and feed this into a robot as instructions.

•The letter-string "RAALAL" means:

Turn right

Advance twice

Turn left

Advance once

Turn left yet again

•Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 2} facing west.
